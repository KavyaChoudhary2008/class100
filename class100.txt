OOPS->Object Oriented Programming
It is a way of structuring code where programmers imagine everything as an object.
We design objects using class(blueprint) and create a new object using class
Python is also object Oriented
--------------------------------------------------------

Indentation is very important in python
A class is defined in python with the keyword 

class Student:

or

class Student(object):

---------------------------------------
_init_ is a predefined function in python and it is very similar to our
constructor in javascript.It is called whenever we create an object
using the class.It takes some arguments and creates an object using arguments.

self -is similar to 'this' keyword in javascript.

------------------------------
python does not need keyword 'new'

you can create new objects using the class by using the class name.

Ex:

John= Student("John",12,6)
This is how we create objects in python
-----------------------------------

class functions which begin with double underscore (--) are called special
functions as they have special meaning.
